<h2 class="a">About Me</h2>
<p> Hey everyone, my name is Stephan Rotolante!</p>
<p> I love to eat PB&Js and build Star Wars Legos.
     I am Senior studying Computer Science at the University of North Florida, 
     I also am looking to get a Minor in Mathematics and Business Management.
    I was born and raised in the Cocoa Beach Florida area, so Jacksonville almost feels like home to me,
    it has that same surf town vibe that I had growing up. Where I am from, Cocoa Beach, is a popular surfing location
    the funny thing is that I am a bd surfer. Not doing a good job of represetning my home town right.
    If you told where I would be today I wouldn't believe you, sometimes I surprise myself on the stuff I accomplish.

<h2 class="h"> Hobbies & Interests</h2>
<p> I have many hobbies and interests. One of my favorite things to do is to play lacrosse.
    That sport has taught me so many life lesson that have really helped with my growth in becoming a man.
    I play on my University's club team and have made friends that I wouldn't trade the world for, I honestly
    wouldn't know where I would be without them. Another hobby of mine is roller blading/roller hockey. I love to
    roller skate because it just gets my mind off things, and helps me to look at things in a different perspective.

<h2 class="e"> Education</h2>
<p> My main education goal is to graduate, not only graduate but actually learn something.

    whole life: Pre-school-Elementry was a Montessori School, middle-high school was at Holy Trinity Episcapol Academy, and finally
